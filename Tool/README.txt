Hello guys,
I just wanted to give you some instructions. I know that this code has some problems and is not very efficient,
 so if you want to update it to make it run more smoothly, feel free to do so.
You have one folder for data that has already been extracted and is ready to use. 
I suggest that, every time someone runs the script, you should also upload the CSV file so that we can all access it.

How to run:

    Start by going to the main page and entering your slug. You can find this in the link to the bet, 
    e.g. 'bitcoin-up-or-down-february-17-10am-et'. The code will find the ID automatically and start running. 
    You can view the log in market_data.txt.

    Once you have finished running, stop everything by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal and you will see 
    that the text file will be filled with logs.

    You should then open the 'txt_to_csv.py' file, input the slug again, 
    and run the code to filter the text file into a clean, ready-to-use CSV file.

If you have any further questions, please send a message. Feel free to correct the code or make improvements.
